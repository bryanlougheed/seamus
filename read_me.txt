To get started with the model:

(1) Either add the directory containing the downloaded files to your MATLAB search path, 
or make the directory containing the downloaded files your current working directory.

(2) Launch the tutorial file (tutorial_matlab.m or tutorial_octave.m) for a step-by-step guide on
running seamus_run (the sediment model) and seamus_pick (the sample picking and 14C-dating module that 
uses output from seamus_run).

For further help on how to run the modules please see the documentation in one of two places:

- The built-in documentation (type 'help seamus_run' or 'help seamus_pick' into the command line)
- The supplementary tables in the manuscript.
